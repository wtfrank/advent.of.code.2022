my effort at advent of code 2022 & 2023 using Rust.

https://adventofcode.com/


UTILITIES
---------
get_puzzle_input allows a day's personal puzzle input to be downloaded. To set this up you need to create a file called session_cookie.txt in the netscape cookie jar format which contains the cookie named "session" which the advent of code website sets after you log in.

BUILD
-----
There is a repo root workspace which builds all solutions with cargo build, or each day's solution can be built in the year/day directory (e.g. 2023/day1)
